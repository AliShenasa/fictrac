* simulate circular fictive path (or find old simulation)
* use simulated fictive path to create test suite for various output parameters
* use test suite to optimise template matching procedure (speed vs accuracy)
* compare accuracy between online mapping, and tracking using pre-loaded map
* async drawing (may drop frames) for live display during fast tracking
* allow specification of r2c_r in config file (at least for testing purposes)
* if vfov is changed - R,t and c,r stored in config file should be recomputed (currently requires values to be deleted and config re-run..)
